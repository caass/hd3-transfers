### Overview

In my work as a data analyst with a government agency, I was given a dataset of digitized case reports of people who came in to private practice doctors, public hospitals, and nursing facilities (both long-term care and long-term acute care) and tested positive for a certain antibiotic-resistant infection (ARI).

Thanks to another government entity, I also obtained a dataset of all of the patient movement in the Atlanta HD3 area within the same timeframe. I merged the datasets and mapped both the denominator data (all patient movement) and the numerator data (ARI movement) to see if the way that patients moved in the HD3 area was indicative of the way the ARI spread.
